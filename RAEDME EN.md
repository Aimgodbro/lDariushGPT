## **Introduction**  
**DariushGPT** is an advanced AI model for Persian language processing, built on the **Transformer** architecture. This model offers various capabilities, including text generation, sentiment analysis, poetry composition, chain-of-thought reasoning, and automatic translation. By leveraging cutting-edge techniques such as **Mixture of Experts (MoE)**, **Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE)**, and **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, DariushGPT has become a powerful tool for multiple applications.
